Pandas challenges for Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp


###Below are the conclusions based on the analysis:


1. This game's demographic is overwhelmingly male, with about 84% of players being males. That is why their contribution to in-game purchases is  more than 5 times higher than female population. They should come up with marketing campaigns specific for female players to capture for players


2. The vast majority of the players of Heroes of Pymoli fall in the age group of 15-29, and they make up the largest portion of the in-game purchases. The developers can come up with innovative ideas to attract more players from the age group of 10-14.


3. The item, "Final Critic" is both the most popular item sold, as well as the most profitable item. The developer should look into this item for inspiration for future releases.
